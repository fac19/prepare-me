This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## **Prepare ME**

Tool for parents to be able to make printable visual stories for themselves quickly and easily.

## **Motivation**

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## **Build status**

Build status of continus integration i.e. travis, appveyor etc. Ex. -

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fac19/prepare-me.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fac19/prepare-me)

## **Screenshots**

Include logo/demo screenshot etc.

## **Tech/framework used**

**Built with**

- React

## **Features**

What makes your project stand out?

## **Code Example**

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## **Installation**

Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## **API Reference**

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## **Tests**

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## **How to use?**

If people like your project they’ll want to learn how they can use it. To do so include step by step guide to use your project.

## **Contribute**

Let people know how they can contribute into your project. A [contributing guideline](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) will be a big plus.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
